# Random-Search-Generator

This script will randomly search based on a provided word list file. The script relies on a signed in account in both Edge and Chrome. Additionally a Chrome UA tool should be installed to force a mobile UA.

There are 2 versions:

rsg.ps1 - Interactive, will leave all instances open for manual cleanup

rsg-auto.ps1 - Can be ran unattended. Will kill all browser instances when done. 

I've included a curated word list that should have most english language curse words removed.
